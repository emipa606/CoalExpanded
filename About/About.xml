Coal in your mountains! Burn wood into charcoal! Use that coal and charcoal to power new work benches, coal braziers and stoves, and a medieval cooler meant to keep food fresh! And more! Pollute the locals?

Adds coal to your game which spawns above and below ground if you use a ground scanner. Refill vanilla benches, torches, and other buildings with coal and charcoal in addition to wood. Additionally, smelt lots of stone blocks to get a little bit of coal. Turn coal into chemfuel.
